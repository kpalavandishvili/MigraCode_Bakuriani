<h1>Ski Resort in Georgia</h1>
 <h2>Bakuriani</h2>
  
<div class="headerContainer">
  <p class="text-justify"> The mountain resort <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQeY3FpjAfw"><em>Bakuriani</em></a> is situated on the northern slope of the Trialeti Range, 29 kilometers from Borjomi, at an elevation of 1,700 meters (5576 feet) above sea level in the sub-tropical zone. The snow blanket remains for 4-5 months but in the summer the aroma of the coniferous trees and other climatic factors create ideal conditions for rest and recreation. It is a paradise for ski lovers and an internationally important winter sports centre, which meets Olympic standards. </p>
<br>
<p class="text-justify">The climate of Bakuriani is transitional from humid maritime to relatively humid continental. The winters are cold and experience significant snowfall while the summers are short. Average annual temperature of the town is 4.3 degrees Celsius. </p>

 <p class="text-justify"> Many tourists as well as locals have traveled by famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/soIDox2PFyM"><em>“Kukushka”</em></a> train that passes through amazing forest and ascends great mountains of Georgia. If you get a chance to visit Tsagveri, Borjomi or Bakuriani resorts of Georgia don’t forget to take the famous train trip as well.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="text-justify"> Borjomi’s famous Kukushka train obtains intangible cultural heritage status. The bridge which connects Tsagveri (a small city in Borjomi Municipality, south-central Georgia) to Tsemi village through a Borjomi-Bakuriani railway line was designed by the French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel by the order of the Romanovs, the Russian royal family. The construction was brought to Georgia in pieces and installed on the river Tsemistskali in 1902. The first “Kukushka” (the Russian nickname for a steam engine) train has completed the Borjomi-Bakuriani route January 1902. Since the railway line went through highly mountainous areas, a Porter-type steam engine was brought from England.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Later, open carriages were added to the train, framed only by handrails. Since 1967, the small steam engine was replaced by an electric engine. The popular “Kukushka” functions still, a favorite of tourists and locals alike.</p>
